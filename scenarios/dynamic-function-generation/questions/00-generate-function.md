I need to score incoming leads. Can you please write a Python function to calculate a `lead_score` from three parameters, `job_title`, `country`, and `company_size`? Use the following rules:

- give +10 points if the `job_title` is "Software Engineer",
- give +5 if `country` name starts or ends with the letter "A", and
- give +20 if `company_size` is over 1000.

Please do provide the function specification in the required format along with the code.
